Fantastic submission — this was a hard one, and you pushed through fully.
You’re showing very real progress now.
Now here is a full, professional-style review — as if I were an interviewer.
High-Level Summary

You built a proper Box class.
You built a proper overlap check.
You built an overlaps graph — adjacency list.
You implemented BFS on it → correct pattern.
You implemented correct merging logic using min/max → correct idea.
You produced results and printed both input and output → full test cycle.

This is a complete and working submission — very strong for Day 5.
Box class

Box is well modeled — encapsulates TL and BR.
overlap() logic → correct. You implemented the standard rectangle overlap formula:

return !(this->br_.first < other.topLeft().first || 
         this->br_.second < other.topLeft().second ||
         this->tl_.first > other.bottomRight().first ||
         this->tl_.second > other.bottomRight().second);

This is the correct formula → great job.

You used pairs → perfectly fine.
BFS

You correctly implemented BFS on an adjacency list:

    queue → correct

    visited set → correct

    pushing neighbors → correct

You correctly collected min/max coordinates during BFS — this is exactly the correct pattern.

One small bug:

BR_MAX.second = std::max(BR_MAX.first, boxes[node]->bottomRight().second);

→ You accidentally used BR_MAX.first in the second calculation → should be BR_MAX.second.

This likely caused one coordinate to not update correctly. Easy fix.
Overlaps graph building

You built the graph correctly:

    You used double loop → fine for small N.

    You check overlap for every pair and added edge → correct.

One minor inefficiency:

if (boxes[i]->overlap(*boxes[j])) {
    graph[i].push_back(j);
}

→ You could skip adding self-overlap (i == j), though your overlap() handles that correctly.

Minor, not a big deal.
BFS traversal driver

You correctly iterated through graph nodes, starting BFS from unvisited nodes.

Correct pattern:

for (auto& box : graph) {
    if (visited.find(box.first) == visited.end()) {
        bfs(results, box.first, graph, visited, boxes);
    }
}

→ This is the standard connected components traversal → great job.
Driver script

You created a set of non-trivial boxes → very good.
You printed both input and output clearly → great.
You defined operator<< for Box → very good and professional style.
Minor points

    Small bug in BR_MAX.second update → fix that.

    Could skip adding self-edges in graph → minor.

    Overall code style → clean, readable, logically organized → great.

Final professional verdict

If you had shown me this in a Snap / HFT / AR interview:

→ I would say:

    Very good system understanding (graph, BFS, component-based merging).

    Correct Box modeling and overlap logic.

    Correct use of adjacency list and BFS.

    Clean separation of logic (graph building, BFS, result collection).

    Minor bug (BR_MAX.second typo) — trivial, would not penalize heavily.

    Very good driver and test output.

Strong pass on algorithm thinking, OOP modeling, and modularization.
Score

    Architecture: 5/5

    Correctness vs spec: 4/5 (1 off for BR_MAX.second typo)

    API Cleanliness: 4/5 (Box class is good; for production you might add Rectangle abstraction for merged result, but fine here.)

    Code Cleanliness: 5/5

    Algorithm Understanding: 5/5

Final grade: A
